\chapter{Background and rationale}

% This is based on the curation/FBC biomodels site. We might want to keep these in sync after chances made to the text.
Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are a mathematical representation of organism-specific metabolism.
Constraint-based analyses of GEMs can be used to investigate metabolic phenomena under diverse conditions \emph{in silico}.
Community standards for consistent model reconstruction, curation, and sharing are crucial to ensure reproducibility, reliability, and FAIR~\cite{stall2019make} sharing of the models.
MEMOTE~\cite{lieven2020memote} was developed to address some of these challenges as a community tool for standardized quality assessment of the models.
However, it is difficult to assess whether constraint-based models, including GEMs, are reproducible because they often have multiple solutions, and their numerical values are not always enumerated in the published manuscripts.
FROG is a community effort for standardized assessment of model reproducibility.

Reproducibility of results is the cornerstone of science, and its assessment is an essential part of curating a model in a repository such as BioModels~\cite{malik2020biomodels}.
Following discussions at dedicated breakout sessions at HARMONY2020\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/135Us6bOWaK4vr1ZClAXwWOjmmykEEwx_geSR8wJEmEY/edit?usp=sharing}}, COMBINE2020\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGI5iAq_lTm1BNCb6GM0o0zlMNPRc6yOJv0iZHGTvOA/edit?usp=sharing}}, and HARMONY2021\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j62z9loPasxZ32t9S9eR6stO9ZHkBq9kDvhxG98lnmA/edit?usp=sharing}}\todo{archive the discussions in the repository}, FROG analysis was developed as an ensemble of constraint-based model analyses that generates a standardized, numerically reproducible reference dataset for a given model, called a \emph{FROG report}.
A corresponding collection of tools that generate FROG reports in a standardized schema was implemented.
We propose that modelers share FROG reports along with their model, which can be used by the modeler or curator to independently assess the reproducibility of a model and ensure that the model data users can validate the results of their model interpretation.

As of 2022, FROG analysis is used in the BioModels' workflow to curate constraint-based models along with the MEMOTE test suite, which provides complementary functionality for validating the model annotation quality.

To allow retrospective curation of previously published models, authors may share a miniFROG report in addition to the autogenerated FROG report.
The miniFROG report is a manually created data table in a standardized schema that lists some result values described in the manuscript and links them to the values in the autogenerated FROG report.\todo{describe MiniFROG}

Sharing FROG (and possibly miniFROG) reports along with the model (models itself typically being shared in the SBML-FBC format~\cite{olivier2018sbmlfbc}) should enable assessment of reproducibility and curation of models and thereby greatly enhance the reuse, extension, and integration of constraint-based models in workflows for new knowledge generation.

\section{Aims and scope}
\label{sec:aims}

This document specifies the FROG analysis, a set of methods to evaluate constraint-based metabolic models.
The primary technical purpose of the FROG analysis is to assess the numerical reproducibility of a model's solution.
Evaluating or comparing FROG reports generated by the model user to these generated by the model author scrutinizes the functionality of the software that generated the report, possibly giving the following assurances:
\begin{itemize}
\item The software of the model user interprets a substantial portion of the model data in the same way as the software of the model author, thus giving the exact flux solutions (e.g., metabolic predictions) for a wide range of analyses.
\item The software that the user employs for simulating or analyzing the model (typically, a solver of constrained linear optimization problems) computes a solution that is compatible with the expectations of the model authors.
\end{itemize}

The information stored in a FROG report may be used as evidence of reproducibility for analyses presented in a manuscript.
Indirectly, FROG reports may also be used to assess the compatibility and quality of modeling software.

In the current version, FROG analysis does \emph{not} aim to ensure the semantics and interpretability of model results or biological validity of the model annotations; tests relevant for that purpose are supplied, e.g., by the MEMOTE suite~\cite{lieven2020memote}.

\section{Terms and definitions}

The requirement level of the wording used in technical sections of this specification (\cref{chap:spec,chap:test}), mainly terms \emph{must}, \emph{must not}, \emph{should}, \emph{should not}, and \emph{may}, are used as specified by RFC~2119~\cite{rfc2119}.

For FROG, the \emph{model} means exclusively a metabolic model encoded in the SBML format~\cite{hucka2003systems} in Level~3~\cite{keating2020sbml} Version~1~\cite{Hucka2018b} or Version~2~\cite{Hucka2019} with the extension for FBC~\cite{olivier2018sbmlfbc} (flux balance constraints).
The \emph{model author} is anyone who constructed and published the model; the term \emph{model user} refers to anyone who uses the model data to reproduce or build upon the model author's results.

\subsection{Metabolic model contents and algorithms}
\label{sec:algos}

\subsubsection{Minimal model interpretation}

Following the SBML-FBC specification, the model must uniquely specify a matrix $\mathbf{S}$ (stoichiometry matrix), vectors $\vec{u}$ (upper bounds), $\vec{l}$ (lower bounds), and a finite sequence of vectors $\vec{c_i}$ (an objective vector for each $i$) that define a set of optimization problems:
\begin{align*}
\max_{\vec{x}}\ \vec{c_i}^\intercal &\cdot \vec{x} \\
\text{such that}\quad
\vec{x} & \geq \vec{l} \\
\vec{x} & \leq \vec{u} \\
\mathbf{S}\cdot \vec{x} &= \vec{0}\;\text{.}
\end{align*}

The model must specify a sequence of identifiers $\vec{g}$ where $g_i$ is the identifier of the $i$-th gene, and $\vec{r}$ where $r_i$ is the identifier of the $i$-th reaction and $|\vec{r}| = |\vec{u}| = |\vec{l}|$.

Additionally, for each reaction, the model must specify a Boolean formula $G_i$ (for the $i$-th reaction) over variables labeled as $g_i$ (for the $i$-th gene), giving the reaction-gene associations.
The reaction-gene association formulas must possess an efficient evaluation method that gives a unique solution for a given assignment of variables.
The gene associations may be specified implicitly by the metabolic model specification or by software assumption; as a common treatment of incomplete data, the modeling software may assume missing gene association formulas to invariably evaluate to true ($\top$).

\subsubsection{Extensions to the minimal interpretation}

Models may contain additional constraints and additions to the objective functions that extend the above simple view of the optimization problem.
Examples of such extensions include additional constraints on variables such as reaction coupling, enzyme availability, kinetics and crowding constraints, specific variable domains (such as binary or integer), quadratic objective terms, non-linear constraints, community production constraints, non-Boolean formulas for gene product associations, and others.

Although FROG currently does not specify how to interpret such extensions, the FROG implementations are allowed to include the extensions in the computation and should include them if the appropriate software implementation is available.
This extends the space of model interpretations reachable by FROG reports, helping the users to uncover additional threats to reproducibility early, likely before the standardization process takes place.
In the future, FROG's standardization of model interpretation aims to follow the standardized extensions to SBML and SBML-FBC.~\cite{keating2020sbml,olivier2018sbmlfbc}

\subsubsection{Algorithms}

\begin{description}
\item[Flux balance analysis (FBA)] For a given objective $i$, find any of the vectors $\vec{x}$ in the above optimization problem that maximize the \emph{objective value} $\vec{a_i} = \vec{c_i}^\intercal \cdot \vec{x}$.

\item[Flux variability analysis (FVA)] For a given objective $i$, find a pair of vectors of objective values for each reaction index $j$, generated by substituting the objective vector in the FBA algorithm for $\pm \vec{e_j}$ ($\vec{e_j}$ is a vector that contains only zeros, except for a single one at position $j$, giving $(\vec{e_j})_j = 1$), and adding a constraint $\vec{c_i}^\intercal\cdot \vec{x} \geq a$ where $a$ is the maximized objective value given by an FBA of the original problem.
Solutions for $-\vec{e_j}$ are called flux minima through the $j$-th reaction; correspondingly, the solutions for $+\vec{e_j}$ are called maxima.

\item[Reaction deletion] Deleting the $i$-th reaction in the model is done by setting $l_i = u_i = 0$. (This step is sometimes called `reaction inactivation' rather than deletion.)
The objective value is then computed using FBA on the modified model.

\item[Gene deletion] Deleting the $i$-th gene in the model is carried out by evaluating formulas $G$ for all reactions over a variable assignment $(\forall j)\ g_j = (j \neq i)$ and deleting all reactions for which their formula evaluates to~$\bot$.~\cite{palsson2015systems}
Again, the objective value is computed using FBA on the modified problem.

\section{Intended use and workflows}

This section describes the intended usage and handling of the FROG report files and associated software from the perspective of several workflows.

\begin{description}
\item[Model author workflow] Upon publishing the model, use FROG software to generate a FROG report.
If applicable, verify that the values in the FROG report match the expectations (e.g., model solves correctly).
Deposit the FROG report together with the model.
Optionally, describe the correspondence of values in an associated manuscript to the values in the FROG report in a miniFROG report, and deposit the miniFROG file.
\item[Model curator workflow] Before publishing the model, generate several FROG reports using many software tools and solvers.
Check that all generated reports are compatible, ensuring that the model is numerically robust.
If supplied, also compare the reports to the FROG report submitted by the author.
\item[Model user workflow] Before using the model data to run computational analysis tasks, generate a FROG report for the model using the same software tool and solver as planned for the computational analysis.
Compare the report to the author's published FROG report, verifying that the analysis software interprets the model correctly and that the preliminary results are reproducible.
\end{description}

The workflows give three corresponding checkpoints where the model irreproducibility can be detected and acted upon:
\begin{description}
\item[Author self-check] By generating a FROG report using some existing FROG software for a published model and tracing back the values reported in a manuscript in the generated report, the authors get additional assurance that their analysis results are easily reproducible.
Comparing additional FROG reports generated by diverse software gives assurance about model portability to different software environments.
If the checks fail, the authors have uncovered a potentially critical inconsistency in the model that typically requires fixing for generated results to be valid.
\item[Deposition utility check] Using the available FROG software, model curators may automatically or semi-automatically reproduce the results of the author self-check, gaining confidence in the reproducibility and repurposability of the model.
If the checks fail, the model deposition process is typically suspended until the authors remove the failures.
\item[Model interpretation check] Model users may (and inevitably will) use diverse software to simulate and analyze the models that the model authors and curators could not predict.
In this case, if a FROG report from the new software (such as a new solver version) is incompatible with the existing reports, the user may have uncovered a software issue or, in case the model has not been curated, a problem within the model.
