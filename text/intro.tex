\chapter{Background and rationale}

% This is based on the curation/FBC biomodels site. We might want to keep these in sync after chances made to the text.
Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are a mathematical representation of organism-specific metabolism. Constraint-based analyses of GEMs can be used to investigate metabolic phenomena under diverse conditions \textit{in silico}.  Community standards for consistent model reconstruction, curation, and sharing are crucial to ensure reproducibility, reliability, and FAIR\todo{Mo: need to define this acronym} sharing of the models. Partially addressing these challenges, MEMOTE\todo{Mo: need to define this acronym or cite it} was developed as a community tool for standardized quality assessment of the models. However, it is complicated to assess whether constraint-based models, including GEMs, are reproducible, because these models often have multiple solutions, and their numerical values are not always enumerated in the published manuscripts. FROG is a community effort for standardized assessment of model reproducibility.

Reproducibility of results is the cornerstone of science and its assessment is an essential part of the curation of a model in the repository such as BioModels. Following discussions at dedicated breakout sessions at HARMONY2020\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/135Us6bOWaK4vr1ZClAXwWOjmmykEEwx_geSR8wJEmEY/edit?usp=sharing}}, COMBINE2020\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yGI5iAq_lTm1BNCb6GM0o0zlMNPRc6yOJv0iZHGTvOA/edit?usp=sharing}}, and HARMONY2021\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j62z9loPasxZ32t9S9eR6stO9ZHkBq9kDvhxG98lnmA/edit?usp=sharing}}, FROG analysis was developed as an ensemble of constraint-based model analyses that generates a standardized, numerically reproducible reference dataset for a given model, called a \emph{FROG report}. A corresponding collection of tools that generate FROG reports in a standardized schema was implemented. We propose that modelers share FROG reports along with their model, which can be used by the modeler or curator to independently assess the reproducibility of a model, and ensure that the model data users can validate the results of their model interpretation.

FROG analysis is currently used in BioModels' workflow for the curation of constraint-based models along with the MEMOTE test suite~\cite{lieven2020memote}, which provides complementary functionality for validating the model annotation quality.

To allow retrospective curation of previously published models, authors may also submit a miniFROG report in addition to the autogenerated FROG report. The miniFROG report is a manually created data table in a standardized schema that lists some result values described in the manuscript, and links them to the values present in the autogenerated FROG report.

Sharing FROG (and possibly miniFROG) reports along with the model (typically in the SBML-FBC format~\cite{olivier2018sbmlfbc}), should enable assessment of reproducibility and curation of models, and thereby greatly enhance the reuse, extension and integration of constraint-based models in workflows for new knowledge generation. 

\section{Terms and definitions}

Requirement level of the wording used in technical sections of this specification (\cref{chap:spec,chap:test}), particularly terms \emph{must}, \emph{must not}, \emph{should}, \emph{should not}, and \emph{may}, are used as specified by RFC~2119~\cite{rfc2119}.

For the purposes of FROG, \emph{model} means exclusively a metabolic model encoded in the SBML format~\cite{hucka2003systems,keating2020sbml} with FBC extension~\cite{olivier2018sbmlfbc}.

Here, model user is distinguished from model author. The former denotes the
person running analysis algorithms on the model (e.g. FBA, FVA, etc.), while the
latter denotes the person who built/reconstructed the model. 

\subsection{Metabolic model contents and algorithms}
\label{sec:algos}

Following the SBML-FBC specification, the model must uniquely specify a matrix $S$ (stoichiometry matrix), vectors $u$ (upper bounds), $l$ (lower bounds), and a finite sequence of vectors $c_i$ (an objective vector for each $i$) that define a valid set of optimization problems:\todo{Mo: This is not general enough. What about constraints like $A x  \leq b$ that crop up in enzyme constrained models? What about integer constraints?}
\begin{align*}
\max_x\ c_i^\intercal &\cdot x \\
\text{such that}\quad
x & \geq l \\
x & \leq u \\
S\cdot x &= 0
\end{align*}

The model must specify a sequence of identifiers $g$ where $g_i$ is the identifier of $i$-th gene, and $r$ where $r_i$ is the identifier of the $i$-th reaction and $|r| = |u| = |l|$. \todo{Mo: should other variable types be included here? Like enzyme concentration?}

Additionally, for each reaction the model must specify a Boolean formula $G_i$ (for $i$-th reaction) over variables labeled as $g_i$ (for $i$-th gene), giving the reaction-gene associations. The reaction-gene association formulas must possess an efficient evaluation method for a given assignment of variables, and should be preferably\todo{Mo: MUST be represented -- why not force the field to use sensible a represention of grrs?} represented in disjunctive normal form (DNF, defined as $\bigvee_i\bigwedge_j o_{i,j}(g_j)$ where $(\forall i,j)\ o_{i,j}(x) \in \{x, \neg x, \top\}$). The gene associations may be specified implicitly by the metabolic model specification or by software assumption; as a common treatment of incomplete data the modeling software may assume missing gene association formulas to be tautologies ($\top$) \todo{Mo: what?}.

\emph{Flux balance analysis (FBA) solution} for a given objective $i$ is any of the vectors $x$ in the above optimization problem\todo{Mo: number as problem P1} that maximize the \emph{objective value} $c_i^\intercal \cdot x$.

\emph{Flux variability analysis (FVA) solution} is a pair of vectors of objective values generated by substituting the objective vector in the above optimization problem for $\pm e_i$ ($e_i$ is a vector that contains only zeros, except for a single 1 at position $i$) for each of $i$ reactions, and adding a constraint $c_i^\intercal\cdot x \geq a$ where $a$ is the maximized objective value given by a FBA of the original problem \todo{Mo: need another index if there are multiple $c_i$ objectives allowed... you have $I \times |x| \times 2$ total extrema}. Solutions for $-e_i$ are called flux minima through $i$-th reaction; correspondingly the solutions for $+e_i$ are called maxima.

\emph{Deletion of $i$-th reaction} in the model is carried out by setting $l_i = u_i = 0$.

\emph{Deletion of $i$-th gene} in the model is carried out by evaluating formulas $G$ for all reactions over a variable assignment $(\forall j)\ g_j = (j \neq i)$, and deleting all reactions for which their formula evaluates to $\bot$.~\cite{palsson2015systems}

\todo{maybe add examples of the math? Mo: I don't think this is necessary, it is too standard in the field.}

\section{Aims and scope}

This document describes the FROG specification. The main technical purpose of FROG analysis is to assess the numerical reproducibility of model solutions. Comparing FROG reports generated by the model user to those generated by the model author gives the following assurances if they correspond:
\begin{itemize}
\item The software of the model user interprets a substantial portion of the model data in the same way as the software of the model author. Thus, the model is expected to give the same metabolic predictions for a wide range of analyses.
\item The solver software computes a valid solution that is compatible with the expectations of the model authors.\todo{Mo: Which solver? For reproducibility, should it not be exactly the same solver as used by the model author? Should there be another test using a different solver to test if the answers are somehow solver specific? This needs to be included in the scope of FROG then. Or do you mean COBRA software like cobrapy, cobrexa, etc?}
\end{itemize}

The information stored in a FROG report may be used as evidence of reproducibility for analyses presented in a manuscript. Indirectly, FROG reports could also be used to assess the compatibility and quality of modeling software.

FROG analysis does \emph{not} aim to ensure the semantics and interpretability of model results or annotations are biologically reasonable; tests relevant for that purpose are supplied e.g.~by the MEMOTE suite~\cite{lieven2020memote}.

\section{Intended workflows}

This section describes the intended usage and handling of the FROG report files and associated software from the perspective of several workflows.

\begin{description}
\item[Model author workflow] Upon publishing the model, use FROG software to generate a FROG report. If applicable, verify that the values in the FROG report match the expectations (e.g., model solves correctly). Deposit the FROG report together with the model. Optionally, describe the correspondence of values in an associated manuscript to the values in the FROG report in a miniFROG report, and deposit the miniFROG file.
\item[Model curator workflow] Before publishing the model, generate several FROG reports using several software tools and solvers. Check that all generated reports are compatible, ensuring that the model does not pose interpretation ambiguity and that it is numerically robust. If supplied, also compare the reports to the FROG report submitted by the author.\todo{at least for enzyme constrained models, this is going to be tough to get people to agree on a standardized way to encode + solve them...}
\item[Model user workflow] Before using the model with your software and solver of choice, generate a FROG report using a software tool that uses the same solver and possibly utilizes the same analysis software. Compare the report to the author's published FROG report, verifying that the analysis software interprets the model correctly and the basic results are reproducible.
