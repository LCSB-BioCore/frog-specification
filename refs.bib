               repository for high-quality genome-scale metabolic models. For the past 12 years,
               the website has allowed users to browse and search metabolic models. Within this
               update, we detail new content and features in the repository, continuing the
               original effort to connect each model to genome annotations and external
               databases as well as standardization of reactions and metabolites. We describe
               the addition of 31 new models that expand the portion of the phylogenetic tree
               covered by BiGG Models. We also describe new functionality for hosting
               multi-strain models, which have proven to be insightful in a variety of studies
               centered on comparisons of related strains. Finally, the models in the knowledge
               base have been benchmarked using Memote, a new community-developed validator for
               genome-scale models to demonstrate the improving quality and transparency of

  title     = {Harmonizing semantic annotations for computational models in biology},
  abstract  = {Life science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses
    about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for
    enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of
    the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to
    knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning
    of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models,
    accelerate model composition and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and
    experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation
    requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based
    annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of
    annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and
    which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms.
    Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological
    modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current annotation practices among the
    COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork community and provide a set of recommendations for
    building a consensus approach to semantic annotation.},

    complexity of computational models. To reproduce simulation results and reuse models,
    researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the
    Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of
    modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form
    consists of a core suited to representing reaction-based models and packages that extend the
    core with features suited to other model types including constraint-based models,
    reaction-diffusion models, logical network models, and rule-based models. The format leverages
    two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build
    and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and
    organs, and new data sources such as single-cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated
    new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges
    presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support
    this evolution.},
